Description: This package includes a function (bayes_theor) that calculate a conditional probability (y given x) using Bayes theorem given 
two probabilities (x and y) and a conditional probability (x given y), or if the two probabilities (x and y)
are independent, it calculates the conditional probability (y given x) without taking a conditional probability 
(x given y) as a parameter. 
This package also includes a function (bayes_theor_extended) that returns a vector 
of probabilities when given a partition of probabilities(x) as a vector and a singular probability(y). The vector returned
gives the probability of each member of the vector of probabilities(x) given a probability(y). 
This package also includes a function that draws a pie chart of the likelihood of the conditional probability in question
occuring or not occuring. This function takes a probability(x), another probability(y), and a conditional probability(x given y).
The function calculates a conditional probability(y given x) using Bayes Theorem and then draws a pie chart of the likelihood of that 
conditional probability occuring and the likelihood of it not occuring.
